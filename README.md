# Scripts-For-eJPT
This is a repo of scripts (some copied) for the eJPT exam.
Yeah so pretty much these scripts could be used for the eJPT exam, the first two C++ scripts (file_stealer.cpp and keylogger.cpp) are directly from the INE lab.
These two scripts can also be found on other GitHub repo as well.
